# Dino_AI
AI that plays the Chrome Dino game using real user inputs

# Description
This code was written some time ago as a personal exercise.
It has been an important learning experience for me, so I decided to share it 
in the hope that others who are beginning to explore Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) and 
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) might benefit from it.

# Installing the necessary libraries
```bash
  pip install -r requirments.txt
```
# Contribution
As mentioned earlier, this was an exercise, and I plan to work on other projects, leaving this repository as it is. 
You are free to use this code as you wish. If you have any fixes or improvements, feel free to open a pull request.
